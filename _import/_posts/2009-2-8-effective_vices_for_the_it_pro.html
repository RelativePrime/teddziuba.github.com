Law, so make sure it's legit.&nbsp; While they make for good entertainment in the evening, there's a real possibility that you can get addicted, and once a vice starts interfering with your work, then you're fucked.<br /><br /><b>Strippers</b><br /><br />If you're the type that easily takes to strippers, you had better come ready to peel of the cabbage: this vice doesn't come cheap.&nbsp; There's also a simple but unrelenting set of rules you need to learn to keep from getting your ass kicked by a bouncer.&nbsp; It's the kind of thing you'll pick up as you go.<br /><br />For the programmer or IT professional, strippers are an excellent choice.&nbsp; You usually show up to the gentleman's establishment with a bit more money than any of the other clients, so you'll be Mr. Popular.&nbsp; Just be respectful of what's going on: it's not so much a smut show as it is a first hand demonstration in a loosely regulated free market.&nbsp; The dancers are there to make a buck, and don't you forget it.<br /><br /><b>Tobacco</b><br /><br />Tobacco is a great vice for the programmer because it's a performance enhancing drug as well as an escape.&nbsp; I recommend either cigars or smokeless tobacco to avoid the growing anti-cigarette movement.&nbsp; A cigar is gangster, and chewing tobacco is stealth.<br /><br />After putting down a nice stogie wrapped in Connecticut shade, you'll feel like it's time for action.&nbsp; Nicotine is a fantastic stimulant - better than caffeine.&nbsp; If you're the work-from-home type, smoking a cigar twenty minutes before you start will send you on your way in a hurry.&nbsp; Avoid the dregs, though: don't buy a cigar in any place that sells gasoline.<br /><br />Chewing tobacco is often overlooked.&nbsp; Yeah, you say it's more of a staple with the Nascar crowd, but that's really just a stereotype invented by the Nascar crowd, designed to keep you damned hoity-toity folks from driving up the cost of a can of chaw.<br /><br />The key part about dip is that you can do it at your desk.&nbsp; Spit into an empty Coke bottle.&nbsp; Nobody will come by to bother you.&nbsp; Plus, think of how authoritative you're going to be at a meeting when you start it off by lipping a fat digger out of a tin of Skoal.<br /><br /><b>Just Keep It Within Reason</b><br /><br />You can judge any vice on two dimensions: how good is it, and how likely is it to interfere with your work.&nbsp; Once a vice becomes more than a vice, you're going to <i>wish</i> you were that guy who goes home to code Haskell.<br /><br />However, there is a convenient side-effect to the addictiveness.&nbsp; If you are aware enough to see your vice getting out of hand, it's probably time to quit your job.<br /><br />Just don't do anything illegal.<br /><br /></div>
