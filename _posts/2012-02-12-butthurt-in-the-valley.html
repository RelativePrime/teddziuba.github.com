title: Dan Lyons vs. The Valley

<p><img src="/images/bring-back-that-numa-numa-kid.jpg" class="post-lead-image">
Evidently Dan Lyons is on the warpath now, against MG Siegler and Mike Arrington, formerly of TechCrunch, now of CrunchFund. You remember Dan Lyons, he was entertaing for about five minutes a couple of years ago as Fake Steve Jobs? This sort of depraved cannibalism is common in Silicon Valley tech media, so it should surprise nobody.
