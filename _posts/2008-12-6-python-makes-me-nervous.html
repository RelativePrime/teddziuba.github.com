Not so in Python.&nbsp; Here, a method signature will only tell you one thing: how many arguments you need to make it work.&nbsp; Sometimes, it won't even do that, if you start fucking around with **kwargs.<br /><br />Calling a colleague's method isn't as easy as looking at the signature.&nbsp; You need to look at the method definition itself to see what it does with its input.<br /><br />Let's look at an example from Thrift, Facebook's open source RPC server.&nbsp; Here's the signature to a TServer constructor in Java:<br />

<pre><code>
protected TServer(TProcessorFactory processorFactory, TServerTransport serverTransport)
</code></pre>

And there are a few other constructors that take different args.&nbsp; Pretty straight forward, if you look at this, you know what you need to instantiate to get your TServer up and running.&nbsp; Now let's look at the Python version:<br />
<pre><code>
def __init__(self, *args):
</code></pre>

So, how do you use it?&nbsp; Big fuckin' mystery!&nbsp; You can't overload constructors in Python, so they had to mash the several different constructors into one.&nbsp; To figure out how to instantiate a TServer, you need to look at the constructor implementation.&nbsp; <i>As a user of the library, the implementation is none of my concern, unless I'm programming in Python.</i><br /><br />What a waste of time.<br /><br /><b>Whatever You Do, Don't Do It Wrong</b><br /><br />What about errors?&nbsp; Python exceptions are what really make me nervous.&nbsp; Your code can run fine for the longest time then shit out with a runtime exception.&nbsp; How do you know what exceptions a method can throw?&nbsp; Well, you don't, unless you look at the method definition.&nbsp; Fantastic.<br /><br />Java has a well thought out hierarchy of checked and runtime exceptions.&nbsp; Sure, handling checked exceptions means you need to write a bit more code, but it's better to spend the time in development than in debugging at 4am.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another example is in order.&nbsp; In Java, the constructor to FileInputStream throws a FileNotFoundException if something goes wrong.&nbsp; Since it's a checked exception, you need to deal with it somehow.&nbsp; The fact that this exception is thrown is made obvious in the documentation, and your code won't compile if you ignore it.<br /><br />Python, on the other hand, prefers to leave things up to chance.&nbsp; This is the documentation for the open() builtin, that opens a file:<br /><br />
<pre>Help on built-in function open in module __builtin__:

open(...)
    open(name[, mode[, buffering]]) -&gt; file object
    
    Open a file using the file() type, returns a file object.
(END) 
</pre>

How does this function handle a failure?&nbsp; Does it raise an Exception?&nbsp; Does it return a special value?&nbsp; Nobody seems to know!&nbsp; Ah, fuck it, that's a runtime problem, right?<br /><br />Sure, runtime exceptions happen in Java, but they are usually things that are indicative of a <b>big</b> fuckup like a NullPointerException, not something stupid like a file not being found.<br /><br />Programming a large project in Python makes me uneasy.&nbsp; Perhaps I'm just doing it wrong?&nbsp; Do other Pythonistas drop a Valium before they begin the day?<br /></div>
