I have done no preparation for this interview beyond looking on the internet for programming interview questions.&nbsp; I'm basically dead wood in this organization, and I pray every day that nobody figures this out.&nbsp; As such, if you come up with the answer quickly, I'll either think you cheated and looked up programming interview questions on the internet, <i>or</i> you're genuinely smart enough to expose my own uselessness should you get hired.&nbsp; In either case, your best course of action here is to pretend like you don't know and let me explain the correct answer with a shit-eating grin on my face.<br /><b><br />The Bullshit</b><br /><br /><i>What The Interviewer Says:</i> Where do you see yourself in five years?<br /><br /><i>What The Interviewer Thinks:</i> I have no idea what I'm doing.&nbsp; I really need to keep this room from going dead-air, so I'll give you something to talk about.&nbsp; Just start talking.&nbsp; I really don't care, say anything.&nbsp; I'm not listening.&nbsp; I'm using this moment to think about the woman working in HR that I want to bone, but wants nothing to do with me because I'm an introverted nerd who will never work up the sack to ask her out.&nbsp; Fuck my life.<br /><b><br />Finally It's Over</b><br /><br /><i>What The Interviewer Says:</i> Do you have any questions for me?<br /><br /><i>What The Interviewer Thinks:</i> We're 35 minutes through a 45 minute interview.&nbsp; If this doesn't take up ten minutes, I can blame ending the interview early on my clock being fast.<br /><b><br />So What Is A Good Interview?</b><br /><br />For once, I'd like to have a 45 minute candid conversation with an interviewee.&nbsp; Talk about interests, shoot the breeze, and get a general idea of the guy's technical aptitude and fit with the company.&nbsp; Talk about projects, see if the guy gets animated.&nbsp; Combine that with some pre-submitted code samples, and you can get a genuine idea of how suited the candidate is.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I would not want to work for or with somebody who is this passive-aggressive.<br /><br />Asking pedantic and useless questions like this is just a waste of everyone's time.<br /></div>
